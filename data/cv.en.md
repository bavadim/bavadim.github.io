## Summary

I am an experienced engineer with 10 years of experience. I have created several large projects from scratch. I will be glad to help you if you need a rapid prototype of an AI-based web service, to solve a practical natural language processing task or to set up a machine learning pipeline. Summary of my experience:

- 10 years of industry experience in backend developing distributed applications and high load systems on Scala and Java.
- 3 years of experience in building NLP software: chatbots, model tuning, building ml infrastructure.
- 2 years of managing own company.

## Core skills

Scala, SciPy, TensorFlow, Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Akka, Play Framework, pandas, Apache Spark, Chatbot Development.

## Projects

I have developed several projects from scratch, including projects for large companies such as Sberbank, Russian Railways, Rospechat. For example, this one: [http://smartnalog.ru](smartnalog.ru). This is a knowledge base on Russian tax law, developed by me from scratch in 3 months. The main challenge of the project was the development of a search engine. This search engine uses AI technologies (USE, ODQA) to select an article from text knowledge base. The question is forwarded to the lawyer if no article is found. Technological stack: python, typescript, tensorflow.

Another projects you can find on [my github](github.com/bavadim).
