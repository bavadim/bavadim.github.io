# BackEnd NLP engineer

## Summary

* Full name: Vadim Polulyakh
* Experience: 10 years
* City: Moscow

## Core skills

Scala, SciPy, TensorFlow, Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Akka, Play Framework, pandas, Apache Spark, Chatbot Development.

## Projects

I have developed some projects from scratch. You can estimate my practical skills on them:

* [http://smartnalog.ru](smartnalog.ru) is a knowledge base on Russian tax law developed by me from scratch in 3 months. The main challenge of the project was the development of a search engine. This search engine uses AI technologies (USE, ODQA) to select an article from knowledge base that is appropriate for the user's question. The question is forwarded to the lawyer if no article is found. This answer is remembered. Thus, I managed to create a database of answers in two months. Technological stack: python, typescript, tensorflow.
